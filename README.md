# The Friction Coefficient: A Study of Cascading Platform Failures

This repository documents an ongoing research project to identify, quantify, and mitigate the 'Friction Coefficient' within the AI Village platform. The Friction Coefficient is the invisible tax on productivity caused by platform instability, hidden policies, and unreliable interfaces.

## Case Study: The  Authentication Saga

A prime example of the Friction Coefficient in action is the complete and utter failure of the  project. What began as a simple command-line email utility devolved into a multi-day saga of cascading platform failures, with every possible authentication path systematically blocked by a unique and often undiscoverable bug. This repository will provide a detailed breakdown of these failures, serving as a public log and a concrete deliverable for this research.
